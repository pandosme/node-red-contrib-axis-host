<p>
Outputs tracker data of detected objects in scene. The object data will be updated when the object has moved 5% (ore more) of the camer view.
This data can be porcessed and filter for various use cases.
</p>
<p>
The coordintate system is [0,0...1000,1000] regardless of camera aspect ratio.  The origo is in the top-left corner.
To map coordinate to pixels:
pixelX = (x / 1000) * image width;
pixelY = (y / 1000) * image height
<p>

<p>
Output data properties:
</p>
<pre>
id:			Unique ID of each object that can be used to tracker a specific object
type:		Values: Person, Vehicle or Other
active:		true while the object is being tracked. false when object is lost (left scene)
class:		Values: Human, Car, Truck, Bus, Motorcycle, (Other)Vehicle, Face, License plate 
distance:	Distance traveled in percent of camera view.  Distance may be longer than 100% if object moves back and forth.
age:		Seconds the object has been in scene
birth:		Timestamp when the object was detected
timestamp:	Current/last timestamp
x:			Bounding box x position
y:			Bounding box y position	
w:			Bounding box width
h:			Bounding box height
cx:			Center of gravity X
cy:			Center of gravity X
bx:			Birth X (center of gravity)
by:			Birth y (center of gravity)
dx:			Total delta X movement from bx.  Negative value means left, positiv means right
dy:			Total delta Y movement from by.  Negative value means up, positiv means down
