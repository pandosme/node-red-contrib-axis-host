Outputs tracker of detected objects in scene. The object data will be updated when the object has moved 5% (ore more) of the camer view.
Place a function node after the tracker node to process logic and add filter.

The coordintate system is [0,0...1000,1000] regardless of camera aspect ratio.  The origo is in the top-left corner.
To map coordinate to pixels:
pixelX = (x / 1000) * image width;
pixelY = (y / 1000) * image height

{
	"id":number,		Unique ID of each object that can be used to tracker a specific object
	"type":"Person",	Values: "Person", "Vehicle" or "Other"
	"active":false,		true while the object is being tracked. false when object is lost (left scene)
	"class":"Human",	Values: "Human", "Car", "Truck", "Bus", "Motorcycle", (Unknown)"Vehicle", "Face", "License plate" 
	"distance": number	Distance traveled in percent of camera view.  Distance may be longer than 100% if object moves back and forth.
